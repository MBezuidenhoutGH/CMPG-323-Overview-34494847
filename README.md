<p>CMPG 323 Project Overview of Student 34494847 at NWU Potchefstroom</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<p>For each project, a new repository will be created, meaning there will be five repositories by the end.
<br/>Project two will be named 'CMPG 323 Project 2-34494847’, project three will be named 'CMPG 323 Project 3-34494847’, project four will be named 'CMPG 323 Project 4-34494847’, project five will be named 'CMPG 323 Project 5-34494847’</p>

<h2>Branching Strategy</h2>
<p>The following diagram indicates the branching strategy that I will be using for each project</p>
<img src="branchstrat.jpg" alt="Branching strategy to be used within each project"/>
<p>There will only be three branches because these projects are individual, in simple terms the Master branch indicates "the final product", and the Bugfix branch is where I will be fixing issues that might occur from the current code from the Master branch, the Feature branch is where I will add new code.</p>
